Remote Variable Sharing for C / C++ 
////////////////////////////////////////////////
Variable Share is supposed to be a (cross-platform? :P ) GNU/GPL layer on top of regular C programs using TCP sockets with witch you can easily 
share Variables between programs running on the same or different machines..

Its usage should be straightforward , just including the header and linking the library and adding 2 lines of code
one for initialization and one for closing it. From there on for each variable ( pointer ) shared an aditional line should 
be added to add the pointer to the VariableShare temporary pointer database. 

It should allow local variables on the scope of a process to be viewed and/or written from a remote process with a very light overhead..
As for security there will only be base line security measures and the whole point is to use it via SSH tunneling or wrap it in an otherwise secured 
connection. 

For debugging ValGrind is a great tool that will be used during the development


Simple Practical Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example lets say an admin has a very complex program on PC#1 and wants to find out the value of the variable "int ServiceNeeded;"


the PC #1 program should have the following structure :

struct VariableShare * vsh = StartVariableSharing("PC1","password");
...
int ServiceNeeded=0;
AddVariableToSharingList(vsh,"ServiceNeeded","R",&ServiceNeeded,sizeof(ServiceNeeded));
...
   /* 
     COMPLEX PROGRAM HERE
   */
...
StopVariableSharing(vsh);



the Admin PC program should have the following structure :

struct VariableShare * vsh = ConnectToVariableSharing("xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:12345","password");

int ServiceNeeded=0;
while ( ServiceNeeded == 0 ) 
  {
       Sleep(1000);
       RefreshLocalVariable(vsh,"ServiceNeeded",&ServiceNeeded,sizeof(ServiceNeeded));
  }
fprintf("Service needed at machine %s\n",vsh->sharename);

StopVariableSharing(vsh);
